# mopub-ios-mediation

Thanks for taking a look at MoPub! We take pride in having an easy-to-use, and flexible monetization solution that works across multiple platforms.
We have separated network adapters from our MoPub SDK repository to enable an independent release cadence resulting in faster certification cycles.
